# CodeLens_testing Documentation

This project demonstrates the implementation of Merge Sort and Binary Search algorithms in C++.  It takes a hardcoded array of integers, sorts it using Merge Sort, and then allows the user to search for a specific number within the sorted array using Binary Search.

## Functionality

This project performs two primary functions:

* **Sorting:** The code sorts an array of integers using the Merge Sort algorithm.  Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that divides the array into smaller parts, sorts those parts, and then combines them back together in the correct order.  It's known for its consistent performance regardless of the initial order of the array elements.

* **Searching:** After sorting the array, the code performs a Binary Search. This search algorithm efficiently finds a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements with each comparison.

## Critical Logic Parts

* **Merge Sort Implementation (`mergeSort` and `merge` functions):**  The `mergeSort` function recursively breaks down the array into smaller and smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only a single element (which is inherently sorted). The `merge` function then combines these sorted subarrays back together. The critical logic here involves comparing the elements of two subarrays and placing them in the correct order within the merged array.

* **Binary Search Implementation (within `main` function):** The code prompts the user for a number to search for within the sorted array. The binary search logic uses two variables, `left` and `right`, to maintain the search boundaries within the array. It repeatedly calculates the middle index and compares the element at the middle index with the target value. If they match, the element is found. If the target value is smaller, the `right` boundary is moved to the left of the middle index.  If the target value is larger, the `left` boundary is moved to the right of the middle index.  This process continues until the element is found or the `left` boundary crosses the `right` boundary (meaning the element is not present).

## Dependencies

The code relies on the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file. This header file includes many standard C++ libraries, such as `iostream` (for input/output), `vector`, and algorithms from `<algorithm>`.  While convenient, relying on this all-encompassing header is generally discouraged in production code for portability reasons.  It's considered best practice to include only the specific headers needed for each function.


## Project History and Updates

The project has undergone several updates based on the commit history:

* **Initial Commit:** The project was initialized with the core sorting and searching functionality.
* **README Update:** The README file was updated to provide a brief description of the project, now called "CodeLens_testing," indicating its purpose as a test for a code lens tool.
* **Further Development:**  Several commits (including "commit 1," "testing commit," and "hi") suggest ongoing development and testing, though the specific code changes are not reflected in the current documentation scope.  These commits might represent bug fixes, performance improvements, or other refinements to the core functionality.
