# CodeLens_testing Documentation

This project demonstrates the implementation of Merge Sort and Binary Search algorithms in C++ alongside a Python implementation of a factorial calculator. It takes a hardcoded array of integers, sorts it using Merge Sort, and then allows the user to search for a specific number within the sorted array using Binary Search.  Additionally, a separate Python script calculates the factorial of a user-provided number.

## Functionality

This project performs three primary functions:

* **Sorting (C++):** The C++ code sorts an array of integers using the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that divides the array into smaller parts, sorts those parts, and then combines them back together in the correct order. It's known for its consistent performance regardless of the initial order of the array elements.

* **Searching (C++):** After sorting the array, the C++ code performs a Binary Search. This search algorithm efficiently finds a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements with each comparison.

* **Factorial Calculation (Python):** The Python script calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user. It includes input validation to handle negative numbers gracefully.

## Critical Logic Parts

* **Merge Sort Implementation (C++ - `mergeSort` and `merge` functions):**  The `mergeSort` function recursively breaks down the array into smaller and smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only a single element (which is inherently sorted). The `merge` function then combines these sorted subarrays back together. The critical logic here involves comparing the elements of two subarrays and placing them in the correct order within the merged array.

* **Binary Search Implementation (C++ - within `main` function):** The C++ code prompts the user for a number to search for within the sorted array. The binary search logic uses two variables, `left` and `right`, to maintain the search boundaries within the array. It repeatedly calculates the middle index and compares the element at the middle index with the target value. If they match, the element is found. If the target value is smaller, the `right` boundary is moved to the left of the middle index.  If the target value is larger, the `left` boundary is moved to the right of the middle index.  This process continues until the element is found or the `left` boundary crosses the `right` boundary (meaning the element is not present).

* **Factorial Calculation (Python - `factorial` function):** The Python `factorial` function uses a loop to iteratively multiply numbers from 1 up to the input number `n`.  It includes error handling to return `None` if a negative number is provided.


## Dependencies

* **C++:** The C++ code relies on the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header file, which includes various standard C++ libraries like `iostream`, `vector`, and algorithms from `<algorithm>`. While convenient for learning, it's generally recommended to include only the necessary specific headers in production code.

* **Python:** The Python script has no external dependencies beyond the built-in Python libraries.


## Project History and Updates

The project has undergone several updates based on the commit history:

* **Initial Commit:** The project was initialized with the core sorting and searching functionality in C++.
* **README Update:** The README file was updated to provide a brief description of the project, now called "CodeLens_testing," indicating its purpose as a test for a code lens tool.
* **Further Development:** Several commits ("general commit," "hi," "testing commit," "commit 1") suggest ongoing development and testing activities. These commits likely represent bug fixes, performance enhancements, or other refinements to the core functionalities.
* **README Update:** The README.md file has been updated, potentially including minor corrections or more substantial changes to the project description.
* **Python Factorial Implementation Added:** A new Python script was introduced to calculate factorials, adding a separate functionality to the project.
* **test_commit_1:**  A commit with a message "test_commit_1" was made, the exact details of which are not specified in the message. This commit could involve changes to any part of the project, including the existing C++ or Python code.
