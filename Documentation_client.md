# CodeLens_testing Documentation

This repository contains code examples for testing a code lens tool.  It includes implementations of sorting and searching algorithms, as well as a more complex simulation environment.

## Overview of Files

* **Codelens_test1.txt:** This file demonstrates sorting (arranging data in order) and searching (finding specific data) using C++.  It uses an efficient sorting method called "Merge Sort" and a fast search method called "Binary Search".

* **Codelens_test2.txt:**  This file also shows sorting using Merge Sort, but it's written in Python. This demonstrates how the same functionality can be implemented in different programming languages.

* **Codelens_test3.txt and Codelens_test4.txt:** These Java files implement a simulated computer system.  They handle how instructions are processed within a simulated multi-core processor, including how data is stored and accessed in a simplified cache memory system. This simulation also includes features like pipeline forwarding to optimize performance.  It simulates key aspects of how real computer processors work.

## Key Features

* **Sorting and Searching:** The C++ and Python examples showcase fundamental algorithms used for organizing and finding data efficiently.

* **Simulated Processor:** The Java files provide a simulated environment for understanding processor behavior, including how instructions are fetched, decoded, executed, and how memory is accessed. This is useful for testing and analyzing code performance.

* **Multi-Core Simulation:**  The Java simulation supports multiple cores, allowing for more complex simulations of parallel processing.

* **Cache Simulation:** The Java code simulates cache memory. Caches are small, fast memory areas that store frequently used data for quicker access, which speeds up program execution.

* **Pipeline Forwarding:** This optimization technique used in the Java simulation helps to reduce delays in the instruction processing pipeline, improving the overall performance of the simulated processor.


## Purpose

These code examples are primarily designed for testing a code lens tool.  They provide different scenarios and complexities for the tool to analyze, allowing developers to assess the tool's effectiveness in understanding and navigating codebases written in various programming languages.
